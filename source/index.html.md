# Introduction

Welcome to the Bright API! You can use our API to access data we hold on you, your subordinates and your company.

We have language bindings in Shell, C#, and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate). You can fork it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

# Authentication

> Before you can integratewith our APIs, you must set up your development environment to get OAuth 2.0 client ID and secret credentials for the sandbox and live environments. You exchange these credentials for an access token that authorizes your REST API calls. To test your web and mobile apps, you create sandbox accounts.

To request acces, please contact us <a href='mailto:github@brighthr.com'>here</a>.

Once you have your client ID, you can request an Access Token.

```chsarp
some c#
```

```shell
curl -v https://someurl/oauth2/token \
   -H "Accept: application/json" \
   -u "client_id:secret" \
   -d "grant_type=client_credentials"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('secret');
```

> Make sure to replace `secret` with your client key.

Once you have the access token you can use it to make API calls by providing it in your headers as in the example.

```
curl -v -X GET https://someurl \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer Access-Token"
```

> Make sure to replace `Access-Token` with your client key.

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>Access-Token</code> with your granted access token.
