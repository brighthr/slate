# Introduction

Welcome to the Bright API! You can use our API to access data we hold on you, your subordinates and your company.

You can view examples in the dark area to the right.

This API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate). You can fork it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.
